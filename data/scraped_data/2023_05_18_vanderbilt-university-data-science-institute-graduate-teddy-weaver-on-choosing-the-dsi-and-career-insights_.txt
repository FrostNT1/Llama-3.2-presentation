Going Back to School with Teddy Weaver May 18, 2023, 2:50 PM Share Teddy Weaver graduated from Vanderbilt University in 2013 and spent over half a decade working in project management before realizing he needed a career change. Recognizing that pursuing a post-graduate degree would lead to a more fulfilling path, he set his sights on data science. Pursuing Data Science Teddy wanted to join a program with a practical approach, focusing on technical skill development. He researched various data science and analytics master’s programs and ultimately chose to return to Vanderbilt and become part of the inaugural 2021 class of MS DS graduates at the Data Science Institute (DSI). The allure of Nashville, a city poised for growth and professional opportunities, played a significant role in Weaver’s decision. He was eager to contribute to the data science landscape of a rapidly developing city. Being part of the DSI’s inaugural class allowed him to provide feedback and shape the program, which excited someone passionate about the field. Teddy also had personal motivations, as he had met his wife at Vanderbilt during their undergraduate years, and with her family residing in Nashville, being close to loved ones greatly influenced his decision. Internships and Post-Degree Career During his time at the DSI, Weaver focused on strengthening his technical skill set. He delved into various tools and technologies, including SQL, Python, and cloud computing. Although he remained open to different industries and job types, Weaver was drawn to roles involving strategy insights and predictive modeling that effectively leveraged data. Teddy gained invaluable experiences through internships, including one with HCA’s data science team, which he secured by maintaining connections in the field. He mentioned that other internship offers didn’t come from his pre-DSI career and advised students not to panic if they don’t secure internships in the fall semester. In his experience, many internship offers came in the mid-spring semester. After completing his degree, Weaver began his career as a data scientist at Thyme Care, a healthcare startup in Nashville. His role, similar to that of an analytics engineer, involves using tools like dB t (data build tool) and constructing data pipelines to support the development of a care management platform. His responsibilities include building data warehouses, modeling data, and creating metrics and dashboards. Additionally, Weaver’s team is exploring predictive work to enhance their services. Advice for Students Reflecting on the factors that contributed to his post-DSI career, Weaver highlighted the advantages of prior work experience. Work experience not only provides better networking opportunities but also sets data scientists apart from data analysts, opening doors to more challenging and specialized roles. Weaver advised students to utilize career centers, practice interview techniques, and seek feedback on their resumes to increase their chances of success. Weaver also said students should keep in mind the significance of networking. Building connections and showcasing one’s personality during interviews can significantly enhance job prospects. He also encouraged individuals to consider specializing within the broad field of data science. Whether it’s developing new AI models, applying advanced methodologies to business problems, or focusing on applied analytics, finding a niche that aligns with personal skills and interests is crucial.
