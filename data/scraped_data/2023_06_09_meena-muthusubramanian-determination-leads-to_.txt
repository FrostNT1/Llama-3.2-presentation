Meena Muthusubramanian: Navigating Borders to Forge a Path in Data Science Jun 9, 2023, 2:11 PM Share Meena Muthusubramanian’s journey into the world of data science is a testament to her determination, adaptability, and passion for merging software and hardware skills. Born and raised in India, Meena pursued a bachelor’s degree in electronics, initially focusing on the hardware aspects of the field. However, her curiosity led her to explore the world of software engineering, where she encountered vast amounts of data that sparked her interest in data science. Pursuing Data Science at Vanderbilt Although she was unaware of the field’s methodologies and approaches at the time, Meena’s realization that data science was more prominent in the United States than in India ignited a desire within her to pursue it further. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and visa restrictions, Meena set her sights on Vanderbilt University, which captivated her with its interdisciplinary courses and renowned research initiatives. The allure of Nashville, with its vibrant atmosphere and professional opportunities, added to the appeal. Virtually touring the campus and the Data Science Institute (DSI) confirmed Meena’s initial impression. She found herself drawn to the people, the challenging curriculum, and the opportunity to explore her interest not only in data science but also in geospatial data science. Meena’s hunger for personal growth and her desire to overcome challenges propelled her to embark on this educational journey at Vanderbilt. Determination at the DSI During her time at the DSI, Meena’s thirst for knowledge and her eagerness to incorporate data science into her previous experience as a software engineer led her to engage in diverse projects. As a research assistant at Peabody College, she explored GIS tools and worked on different sets of tools that piqued her interest. Simultaneously, she found solace in the library, where her love for books was brought to life. Meena’s commitment to both her studies and her personal interests allowed her to fully immerse herself in the DSI experience. As Meena progressed through her master’s program, she understood the importance of gaining practical experience through internships. Undeterred by the competitive nature of the job market, Meena applied for over 300 internships, leveraging every opportunity that came her way. Initially, she faced rejections, but rather than getting discouraged, she used each setback as a chance for growth. With persistence and a willingness to learn from her experiences, Meena refined her resume, tailored it to specific job descriptions, and continued applying. In her pursuit of internships, Meena also sought guidance from the Career Management Center led by Brook Meissner. The career center provided valuable resources, mentorship, and networking opportunities that helped Meena navigate the complex job market. Brook Meissner’s expertise and support played a significant role in Meena’s internship search, boosting her confidence and helping her develop effective strategies. Meena’s persistence and dedication eventually paid off when she secured two internship offers. These internships provided valuable learning experiences and exposed her to new tools and technologies beyond the DSI curriculum. Working remotely for Kennametal during the summer, she expanded her skill set with tools like Power BI, which bridged the gap between electronics and data science. Securing a Job As her internship drew to a close, Meena embarked on the next phase of her journey: securing a full-time position. Applying for full-time positions proved to be a more arduous task, especially as an international student facing visa restrictions. However, Meena’s unwavering determination led her to persevere. She intensified her job search, reached out to professionals in the field, and continued building connections. Her efforts paid off when she received an offer from Intel, a dream company that seamlessly integrated electronics and data science. Reflecting on her time at the DSI, Meena recognizes the pivotal role it played in shaping her into the data scientist she is today. The institute provided her with the knowledge, resources, and networking opportunities necessary to thrive in the competitive world of data science. Advice for students Meena’s journey extends beyond her achievement at Intel. She actively engages with current students, particularly international ones facing the job market challenge. Meena advises aspiring data scientists to be proactive, fostering communication, collaboration, and interaction with classmates to navigate the competitive and demanding nature of the field. Her mantra, “communicate and collaborate,” is a testament to her success. She encourages students to explore extracurricular groups and highlights the International Student Council, which offers weekly meetings, field trips, and networking opportunities across various disciplines. Meena’s proactive approach resonates with prospective students, urging them to stay ahead and make the most of the remarkable opportunities at Vanderbilt University.
