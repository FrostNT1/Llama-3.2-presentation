WATCH NOW: Deepen Your Understanding of Algorithms and Architectures with optional AI Summer workshop May 19, 2023, 1:31 PM Share The Data Science Institute hosted an optional workshop for our AI Summer participants in which we discussed the algorithms and architectures that make transformer models possible. The workshop is now open to everyone on our YouTube page. During the workshop, the Data Science Team discusses the influential paper “Formal Algorithms for Transformers” by Mary Phuong and Marcus Hutter. You can access the paper here. We recommend reading through the paper, paying particular attention to the introductory sections. Some notation may be unfamiliar, but you can leverage the power of ChatGPT, GPT4, BingChat, Claude, or Bard to help explain any complex concepts that may arise. You can watch the workshop here.
