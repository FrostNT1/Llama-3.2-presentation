Scholarships Vanderbilt Data Science offers a few scholarships ranging from 25%-100% of tuition to our top incoming students each year. To be considered for a scholarship, applicants must apply by the January 3rd deadline. Women in Technology of Tennessee (WiTT) Vanderbilt’s M.S. in Data Science is proud to have a program that is nearly 50% women and 50% men. To achieve this goal, we partnered with the Women of Technology in Tennessee (WiTT) to offer a scholarship to one high achieving woman applicant. Vanderbilt will offer a 100% tuition scholarship for a female WiTT member who is admitted to the MS program. This is our only scholarship that requires a separate application, so if you are interested in being considered, please don’t forget to indicate that on your application and apply separately through WiTT. WiTT is an organization that promotes women in technology through education, scholarships, community outreach and networking. Having a strong network of like-minded women allows WiTT members to find job opportunities, stay current with industry trends, and solve challenges in the workplace. Because our goals are aligned, WiTT is an ideal partner for Vanderbilt’s M.S. in Data Science program. We hope to continue promoting gender parity in STEM careers and our scholarship with WiTT will help us achieve this goal. View the story of our first WiTT scholarship winner here. You can find detailed instructions on how to apply for this scholarship on the WiTT scholarship website.
