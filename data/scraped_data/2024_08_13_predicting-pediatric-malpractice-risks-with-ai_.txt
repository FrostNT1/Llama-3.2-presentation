Predicting Pediatric Malpractice Risks with AI Aug 13, 2024, 8:45 PM Share Preverity – Predicting Pediatric Malpractice Risks with AI In collaboration with Vanderbilt Data Science, Preverity launched a project aimed at developing a predictive model to assess malpractice risks in pediatric healthcare. This initiative was driven by the need to enhance patient safety in a particularly vulnerable population. By employing advanced logistic regression models with Lasso regularization, the project sought to create a tool that healthcare providers could use to identify potential risks before they manifest, ultimately improving the quality of care. Predictive Modeling for Pediatric Malpractice The project was spearheaded by a student who undertook the challenge of building a model capable of predicting the likelihood of malpractice occurrences in pediatric medicine. The student applied a combination of statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to develop a model that not only predicts risk but also provides insights into the factors that contribute to these risks. The ultimate goal was to create a data-driven tool that could be integrated into healthcare systems to support better decision-making and reduce the incidence of malpractice. Project Highlights: Throughout the course of the project, the student focused on several areas essential to the development of an accurate and reliable predictive model. These highlights include: Session Insights: The collaboration between Preverity and Vanderbilt Data Science illustrates how data science can be applied to healthcare, particularly in assessing pediatric malpractice risks. The project contributed to healthcare analytics and underscored the role of predictive modeling in enhancing patient safety and outcomes. What is a capstone project?
