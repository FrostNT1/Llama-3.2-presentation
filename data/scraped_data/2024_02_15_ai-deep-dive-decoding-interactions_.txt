AI Deep Dive: Decoding Interactions Feb 15, 2024, 2:28 PM Share AI Deep Dive: Decoding Interactions Event Overview Join us for an AI Deep Dive session, where we’ll feature a team of VUMC researchers led by Dr. Eric Skaar, in collaboration with our dedicated Data Science team. Dr. Skaar’s laboratory, which is focusing their work in infectious diseases, looks to gain deeper insights into Staphylococcus aureus, commonly known as Staph. This bacterium, known for causing various infections, has a complex interaction with human cells, especially within the immune system. During our deep dive, we will discuss and explore the innovative use of AI and genome-wide imaging to unravel the intricacies of host-pathogen dynamics.
