# Overview: LLaMA 3.2

### 1. Context: Why the LLaMA Family Exists
LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) models were developed by Meta with the goal of providing open-source large language models that rival proprietary models. The motivation behind the LLaMA family, particularly with LLaMA 3.2, is to:

1. Close the gap between open-source models and proprietary ones in terms of performance, accessibility, and ease of fine-tuning.
2. Optimize scalability and efficiency, allowing high-performance models to be deployed and fine-tuned even in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices or smaller labs.
3. LLaMA 3.2 introduces multimodal capabilities (text + image) in its larger models (11B and 90B) while maintaining its hallmark features of scalability, efficiency, and accessibility in its smaller models (1B and 3B).

#### Benchmarks for Lightweight Instruction-Tuned Models
